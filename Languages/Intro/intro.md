## Introduction to Programming
This is a general introduction to programming.  It covers concepts that apply to almost all Object Oriented Languages (OLL) and doesn't focus on a particular language.  The goal is to help you understand how code works at a more basic level and will help you to interpret the some of the cryptic error messages that you get back when you compile a program.

## Proposed Topics
- Program files, compilers, linkers, and loaders.
- Stacks, Heaps, and program execution.
- Memory allocation.
- Variable storage and memory pointers.
- Variable scope.
- Declarations and definitions. 
- Functions and parameter passing.
  - Pass by value
  - Pass by reference
  - Return values
