# <a name="top"></a>Subsystems

Subsystems are the basic units of functionally for our robot, such as drive trains and mechanical arms.  They encapsulate low-level hardware objects (motor controllers, sensors, etc) and provide methods that can be used by Commands.  We represent subsystems in code by using [Objects](../Programming/objects). Objects are composed of [Data Structures](../Programming/dataStructures) and [Procedures](../Programming/procedures), as explained in [Introduction to Programming](../Programming/introProgramming). You should learn those concepts before we look at the subsystems that are on the Romi.  

 For this module the majority of the code implementation can be found in the [Subsystems](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/subsystems.html) section of the FRC Documentation.

## DriveTrain Subsystem
The Romi uses a drive train called a [Differential Drive](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/actuators/wpi-drive-classes.html#using-the-differentialdrive-class-to-control-differential-drive-robots). There are three types of Differential [Drive Train Modes](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/actuators/wpi-drive-classes.html#drive-modes) that can be implemented. The Romi will make use of at least two of them. To understand what type of maneuvers are possible using a Differential Drive robots you can look at the [Robot Kinematics](../Concepts/Dynamics/kinematics) module. The *DifferentialDrive* class takes the left and right motors as parameters that are wrapped in the *PWMSpeedController* class.  The primary task of the *DifferentialDrive* class is to convert a single speed (unicycle model) into speed for the left and right side of the chassis.

The primary job of the *Drivetrain* subsystem is to send speed commands to its motors.  This is done in the `arcadeDrive()` method where we pass in the required translational and rotational speed.  The *DifferentialDrive* object will take care of controlling the speed to the left and right motors based on the kinematics of the drivetrain type. 

    public void arcadeDrive(double xaxisSpeed, double zaxisRotate) {
        m_diffDrive.arcadeDrive(xaxisSpeed, zaxisRotate);
      }

Other procedures in the Drivetrain class will take care of resetting and reading the wheel encoders.  It'll also translate the wheel encoder values into distances, as explained in the [Pose Estimation](../Concepts/OptimalEstimation/odometry) module.  Also checkout [Using the WPILib Classes to Drive your Robot](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/actuators/wpi-drive-classes.html?highlight=speedcontroller#multi-motor-differentialdrive-with-speedcontrollergroups) for more information on implementing a drive train in FRC.

## RomiGyro Subsystem
The RomiGyro subsystem reads values from its gyro in order to perform [Pose Estimation](../Concepts/OptimalEstimation/odomety). The raw data that comes from gyros is very complex and difficult to intepret.  The RomiGyro subsystem translates the data into simple angles and rates-of-turn that are much easier to understand.

## Subsystems Lab
There are two tasks for this lab:

- Update the RomiGyro to make use of an Interface.
- Create a method to get the current heading of the robot.

### Add Interface to RomiGyro
[RomiGyro Interface solution](solutionRomiGyro)

### <a name="heading"></a>Create Heading Method
In future modules we're going to need to get the current heading of the Drivetrain.  This heading is obtained from the Gyro that is defined as a subsystem of the Drivetrain as indicated above.
