# Robot Characterization
“Characterization” - or, more formally, system identification - is the process of determining a mathematical model for the behavior of a system through statistical analysis of its inputs and outputs.

To install the Robot Characterization Tool follow the [Installing and Launching](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-characterization/introduction.html#installing-and-launching-the-toolsuite) instructions.  Once you have it installed, open a powershell or terminal and type `frc-characterization drive new`

Start up the *romi-characterization* program and follow the [Romi Characterization](https://github.com/bb-frc-workshops/romi-examples/tree/main/romi-characterization) instructions.
