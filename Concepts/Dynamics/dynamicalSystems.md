# Dynamical Systems
Descibes the change in the state of a system over time. Formally, Describes the evolution of the state of a system.

Constraints can be position constraints (something in the way), control constraints (limited amount of torque), model constraints (system kinematics, holonomic constraint).

A nonholonomic constraint does not restrain the possible configurations of the system, but rather the manner in which those configurations can be reached. While a holonomic constraint reduces the number of degrees of freedom of a system by one, a nonholonomic constraint does not.

Linear and Non-linear systems.


Data-driven dynamical systems makes non-linear systems amenable to linear analysis.
