# Dynamics
Dynamics describe how a system moves in time and space under the action of forces.  More formally, it describes the evolution of the state of a system. Robot dynamics is concerned with the relationship between the forces acting on a robot and the accelerations that they produce. 

We'll start by looking at the position and orientation of the robot and then get into a more formal definition of a dynamical system. We'll then describe how a mobile robot can move over time given its kinematics.  

<!-- We'll then look at motion profiles and trajectories that can be produced by forces acting on the system. -->
