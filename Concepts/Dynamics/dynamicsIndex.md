# Dynamics
Dynamics describe how a system moves in time and space under the action of forces.  More formally, it describes the evolution of the state of a system. Robot dynamics is concerned with the relationship between the forces acting on a robot and the accelerations that they produce. 

We'll start by looking at the position and orientation of the robot and then describe how it can move over time given its kinematic constraints.  We'll then look at motion profiles and trajectories that can be produced by forces acting on the system.
