# <a name="top"></a>Dynamics
Dynamics describe how a system moves in time and space under the action of forces.  More formally, it describes the evolution of the state of a system. Robot dynamics is concerned with the relationship between the forces acting on a robot and the accelerations that they produce. 

We'll start by looking at the Position and Orientation of the robot referred to as its Pose.  We'll then describe how a mobile robot can move given its *Kinematics* and constraints. *Dynamical Systems* will bring the notion of time into the equation and will present a more formal definition of a dynamical systems.  *System Identification* will characterize our physical robot to produce parameters that will allow us to control it. Finally, we'll then look at *Motion Profiles* and *Trajectories* that can be tracked by applying forces to the system.
