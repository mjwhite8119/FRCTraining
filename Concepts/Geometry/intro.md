## Robot Geometry

In order to describe the motion of an object, you must first describe its position â€” where it is at any particular time.  Moreover, the position needs to be specifed relative to a suitable reference frame.  When we are navigating in a car using a GPS system our reference frame is the Earth.  In the case of FRC, a suitable reference frame is the competition field.  The position of an object is generally represented by the variable **x**.

The position of a robot can be represented as a point in 3D space.

If the robot moves then this can be modelled using a transformation.
