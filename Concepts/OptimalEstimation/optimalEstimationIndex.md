# Optimal Estimation
A robot's sensors, dynamical model, and actuators do not behave in an ideal way. Sensors do not give noise free measurements, models don't capture all of the information that matters, and wheels will at some point slip.  This section explains random processes and looks at ways in which we can make a robots actions more certain in an uncertain world.
