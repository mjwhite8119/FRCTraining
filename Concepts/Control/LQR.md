## Linear Quadractic Regulator LQR
Linear Quadratic Regulators work by finding trade-off that drives our system to its desired setpoint while using the minumum control effort. For example, a spaceship might want to minimize the fuel it expends to reach a given reference, while a high-speed robotic arm might need to react quickly to disturbances and reach the setpoint quickly.

Watch this [LQR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_RDCFOlJx4&t=55s) video for a good explaination of the **Linear Quadratic Regulators**.
