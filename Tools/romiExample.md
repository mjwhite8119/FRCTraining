# <a name="code"></a>Romi Example Code
We're going to start by loading the example code that comes with the WPI libraries.  The example code project has a pre-built Drivetrain class and associated default command that lets you drive the Romi around using a gamepad. Here's the documentation for loading the [example code](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/programming-romi.html).

The example code does not run on the Raspberry Pi.  It runs on your development laptop computer and uses the WPILib simulation framework to communicate with the Romi robot.  The gamepad will therefore have to synced with you laptop in order to work with the Romi. 

## Connecting the Gamepad
Get the gamepad configured with the PC.

## Robot Simulator
Explain the simulator.

Make sure that desktop support is enabled.



Here's the documentation for the [Robot Simulator](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/introduction.html)


Play around with the robot.
