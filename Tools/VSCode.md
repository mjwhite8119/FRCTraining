# Visual Studio Code
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a piece of software that is used to make writing code easier. Some of the main things IDEs will help with include: 

- Check the syntax of your code to ensure you don’t have any errors.
- Organize your files and give you a convenient way to view them.
- Allow you to navigate through your code easily.
- Applies colour schemes to your code so it’s easier to interpret.
- Some will have code completion, which will actually fill in some code for you. 

Visual Studio Code is the supported IDE for programming an FRC robot. If you don't have VSCode installed on your computer the best way of doing this is to follow the instructions on the [FRC Documentation Website](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html). These instructions will also install the WPI Library which is used for programming the FRC robot.
