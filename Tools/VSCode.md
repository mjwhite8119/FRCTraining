## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is the supported development environment for programming an FRC robot. If you don't have VSCode installed on your computer the best way of doing this is to follow the instructions on the FRC Documentation Website [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html). These instructions will also install the WPI Library which is used for programming the FRC robot.

Here are some videos that give you a good introduction to VSCode:
