# BabyBot Training Robot
The <i>BabyBot</i> is designed to be used as a teaching tool for programming teams involved in the <i>First Robotics Competition (FRC)</i>.  The code for this robot can be found in the [BabyBot Github Repository](https://github.com/mjwhite8119/FRCRobot). There are multiple <i>Git</i> code branches in this repository and each branch builds on the previous one to create a functioning mobile robot. 

The Bill-of-Materials and construction of this robot is described below. To setup the development environment and start the lessons follow the these links:
