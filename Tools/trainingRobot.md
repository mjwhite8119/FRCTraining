## Training Robot for FRC Programming Teams
The <i>Training Robot</i> is designed to be used as a teaching tool for programming teams involved in the <i>First Robotics Competition</i>.  FRCRobot code in the master branch is the introductory level code and should be installed first to begin the course. This introductory level code creates the basic structure of the robot that will be used throughout the course of training. The FRCRobot code has multiple <i>Git</i> branches.  Each branch will build on this basic structure to add more functionality. 

The code is installed on a small Arduino based training robot.  The Bill-of-Materials and construction of this robot is described below.
