# Training Robot for FRC Programming Teams
The <i>Training Robot</i> is designed to be used as a teaching tool for programming teams involved in the <i>First Robotics Competition (FRC)</i>.  The code for this robot is in the Github repository at [this](https://github.com/mjwhite8119/FRCRobot) location. There are multiple <i>Git</i> code branches in this repository that introduce increasing levels of complexity.  The first introductory lesson 1 code creates the basic structure of the robot that will be used throughout the course of training. Each lesson will build on this basic structure to add more functionality. 

The code is installed on a small Arduino based training robot that uses an ESP32 microcontroller.  The Bill-of-Materials and construction of this robot is described below. To setup the development environment and start the lessons follow the these links:

- [Development Environment Setup](ide)
- [Lesson 1 - Basic Robot Structure](code1)
- [Lesson 2 - Controlling Motor PWM](code2)
- [Lesson 3 - Adding Wheel Encoders](code3)
- [Lesson 4 - Open Loop Velocity Control](code4)
- [Lesson 5 - Closed Loop Velocity Control](code5)
- [Lesson 6 - Closed Loop Position Control](code6)
- [Lesson 7 - Gyroscope and Angular Motion](code7)

## Hardware Components and Contruction
To build the robot for these lessons you will need to get the following components and follow the construction steps:
