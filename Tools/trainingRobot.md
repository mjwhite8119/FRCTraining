## Training Robot for FRC Programming Teams
The <i>Training Robot</i> is designed to be used as a teaching tool for programming teams involved in the <i>First Robotics Competition</i>.  The code for this robot is in the Github repository at [this](https://github.com/mjwhite8119/FRCRobot) location. There are multiple <i>Git</i> code branches in this repository that introduce increasing levels of complexity.  The first introductory version-1 code creates the basic structure of the robot that will be used throughout the course of training. Each branch version will build on this basic structure to add more functionality. 

The code is installed on a small Arduino based training robot.  The Bill-of-Materials and construction of this robot is described below.
