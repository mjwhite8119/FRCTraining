# Objects
Objects are programming constructs that are used to represent physical objects and ideas in the real world.  Real world objects will have what are called attributes, which are pieces of data that describe the object.  An example of this may be a diameter that describes how large a wheel is, or a wheel position that tells you how far a wheel has rotated.  The first is and example of a constant data type since the diameter of a wheel will not change.  The latter is a variable data type since the position on the wheel may be changing.

They contain procedures....
The nature of an object limits the procedures that it can perform.

Are derived from [classes](./classes)
