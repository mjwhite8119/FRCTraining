# Data Structures

Robots are driven by data.  They receive data from external sensors like cameras, internal sensors such as encoders, and from commands sent to it by a controller.  Once they receive the data the robot processes it and may carry out actions based on that data.  Data can be organized in several ways, which we call data structures.  We'll go over some of the most important data structures used in robotics.
